            The benefits of talent pool mapping include:<br>

            - understand how your talent pool is built up in terms of age distribution, gender, succession planning needs<br>
            - understand how the talent pool will evolve over the next 2, 3, 5, or 10 years<br>
            - trace individual potential capability<br>
            - ensure continuity of leadership through effective succession planning<br>
            - identify key roles that need to be filled now and in the future<br>
            - who is overpaid or underpaid<br>
            - identify specific employees who are able to fill key roles<br>
            - identify other employees with future potential<br>
            - create individual development plans<br><br>

            Duration of a mapping exercise:<br>
            - between 1 and 3 months, depending on the size and structure of your organization.</p>
