                  We assessed the design of organizations, whether the structure is just right (not too big, not too small) for executing the strategic plan. We analysed the relationship between tasks, functions, mission, and vision.

                <p class='margin-top-what'>
                  We trained hundreds of managers in managerial leadership practices (there are eleven practices to learn). These are simple, straight forward practices for which all managers are accountable. They go together with policies and procedures in organizations.

                <p class='margin-top-what'>
                  You've probably experienced that assigning tasks may appear deceptively simple. You've probably also experienced then when time and effort are wasted because of poor task formulation. We've helped managers sharpen the formulation of a task. With context, purpose, quality & quantity, resources and time, managers discovered a common definition for tasks.
